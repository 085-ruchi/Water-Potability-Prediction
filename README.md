# Water-Potability-Prediction

Developed a machine learning model to predict water potability, addressing water quality issues and 
improving safety in hostel environments.  
# EDA: 
Performed exploratory data analysis with bar charts, histograms, and pie charts, cleaned and prepared 
data for modeling.  
# Modeling & Evaluation: 
Trained 8 ML models (Random Forest, bagging classifier, decision tree, SVM, etc.)  
and evaluated with confusion matrices, ROC curves, and key metrics.
